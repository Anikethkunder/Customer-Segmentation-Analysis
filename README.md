As part of my Data Analytics project, I conducted customer segmentation analysis for an e-commerce company. The aim was to analyze customer behavior and purchase patterns to group customers into distinct segments. This segmentation helps inform targeted marketing strategies, improves customer satisfaction, and enhances overall business strategies.

Key Concepts and Challenges:
Data Collection: Obtain a dataset containing customer information, purchase history, and relevant data.
Data Exploration and Cleaning: Explore the dataset, understand its structure, and handle any missing or inconsistent data.
Descriptive Statistics: Calculate key metrics such as average purchase value, frequency of purchases, etc.
Customer Segmentation: Utilize clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means) to segment
customers based on behavior and purchase patterns.
Visualization: Create visualizations (e.g., scatter plots, bar charts) to illustrate customer segments.

Learning Objectives:
1. Practical experience with clustering algorithms.
2. Data cleaning and exploration skills.
3. Visualization techniques for conveying insights
